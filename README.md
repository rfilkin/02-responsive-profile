# 02-responsive-profile
This is a revision of my profile that is meant to be responsive with screen adjustment, using bootstrap integration.

Resizing the window will cause the content on my pages to resize, into one of 3 different sizes. However, making the window too small will cause all content to snap back to maximum size. I unfortunately wasn't able to figure out how to fix this bug.
